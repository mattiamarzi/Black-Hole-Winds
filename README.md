Layers of ionized plasma, in the form of winds ejected from the accretion disk of Supermassive Black Holes are frequently observed in Active Galactic Nuclei. These winds are extremely fast and energetic to a point in which they could play a key role in the co-evolution between the SMBH and the host galaxy! Thus, it is extremely important to be able to describe these winds properly taking into account special relativity.

In this project, assuming a density profile n(r) = n_0 (\frac{r}{r_0})^{-α}, I first represented the winds parameters Δr (the wind thickness), ξ (the ionization parameter) and v (the velocity) as functions of N_H (the column density) neglecting and considering special relativistic effects and for different r_0 (the launching radius):

Then, I represented the parameters N_H, Δr, ξ, and the velocity of the outermost (v_{top}) and innermost (v_{bottom}) parts of the wind as functions of time and for different r_0 neglecting special relativistic corrections:

and considering special relativistic corrections:

In all te codes it is also possible to set the Eddington ratio λ_{Edd} and the density profile α.
