All the code is in python and the different files can be executed separately.

In the files norel_parametervariation.py and rel_parametervariation.py I represented Δr (the wind thickness), ξ (the ionization parameter) and v (the velocity) as functions of N_H (the column density) neglecting and including special relativistic effects respectively and for different r_0 (the launching radius).

In the files norel_timevariation.py and rel_timevariation.py I represented N_H, Δr, ξ, and the velocity of the outermost (v_{top}) and innermost (v_{bottom}) parts of the wind as functions of time and for different r_0.

In all te codes it is also possible to set the Eddington ratio λ_{Edd} and the density profile α.
